DRYES - DRought intensitY Evaluation System
=============================

Welcome to the **DRYES** GitHub repository. DRYES offers a suite of indices to estimate drought severity, duration, and extent. DRYES is open source and under development. We welcome collaborations!

Repo dryes-envs provide bash routines to automatically set up the Python environment needed by DRYES. Just download the repo and execute setup_fp_env_python_dryes.sh!

Note that requirements_fp_env_python_dryes.yaml is critically needed to track all requirements and dependencies!
